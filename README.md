## Introduction

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks stacked in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

This project brings this classic puzzle to life with a 3D interface, allowing users to interact with the game in a visually engaging way.
